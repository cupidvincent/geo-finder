git checkout origin master
npm install
npx react-native run-android

note:
Ensure that you have Google Play Services installed
For the Genymotion emulator, you can follow these instructions.
For a physical device you need to search on Google for 'Google Play Services'. There will be a link that takes you to the Play Store and from there you will see a button to update it (do not search within the Play Store).
